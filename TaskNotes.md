# Task Notes

#### Inital Plans
- Create basic wireframe ✔️
- Finalise wireframe ✔️
- Create flow diagram
- Fork and clone repository ✔️
- Import any of the necessary dependencies I will be using ✔️
- Create the inital layout of the page that should be responsive (session list and weekly log) ✔️
- Read from json file locally when running from HTML? (Dont know if possible unless hosting online due to security?)
- Create necessary components
- Incorporate components into layout ✔️
- Add functionality to select a session and add to chosen day ✔️
- Add functionality to remove a session from a chosen day ✔️
- Add functionality to complete a session on a chosen day
- Finalise mobile design/styling
- Finalise desktop design/styling
- Create vueJS Cli project to build and then host on github pages?

#### Amendments I would make
- I would have installed VueJs through NPM but
  - Due to the requirements of this test needing to run from a simple html page I decided to import dependencies through the script tag
  - The advantage to this is it can be easily set up and implemented onto certain pages without having to change infrastructure
  - The disadvantage to this is you lose some functionality 

#### Future Changes
- Add saving for the weeks session
  - This could be done by writing to a new json file or overwriting the current data.json
  - Alternatively a simple database could be created (Either SQL or NoSQL) to store this information against a user
- UI/UX Improvements
  - The ability to drag and drop sessions from the left column onto the table to add a session
  - Add notes to each of the sessions or days
  - History view of previous weeks sessions completed
- Write saved session to json file to be able to be loaded from?
